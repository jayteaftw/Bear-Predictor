# Bear-Predictor

The Bear Predictor is a pytorch model created using fastAi that is able to predict 7 of the 8 kinds of bears: Grizzly, Black, Polar, Panda, Andean, Sloth, and Sun Bear.

For the model, it uses a Resnet 152 Architecture wit 6 epoch and Radom Resize for data augmentation.

The goal of this project was to use and develope a understanding of deeping learning in pytorch.
